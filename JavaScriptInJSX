import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dome/client";

const elem=<span>React Element</span>
const title = (
  <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
    {elem}
    Namste React using JSX
  </h1>
);

const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div id="container">
    <h1>{100+200}</h1>//This code will print 300 in web browser. We inject any java script code in {} JSX. Whether you write console.log("print this log") will also work. Because its java script code. 
    {title}//title is nomral java script variable while code is in title of JSX. and it will print Namste React using JSX. 
    <h1 className="heading">Nmaste React Functional Component</h1>
  </div>
);

const root=ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<HeadingComponent/>);
//Remember if I want to print title then I need to write following. root.render(title);


One use case

Lets consider there are below line 
const data=api.getData();

now in below line of code
{data}

If data variable have some java script code then it will be executed and if this java script code have some java script code then it will impact your system means can steal info or can 
do any other harm.(called "cross site scripting"), 

In above case JSX code, it will sanitize any peiece of code and will be taken care by itself. No need to worry about this.
