what is CDN
what is crossorigin
why there are two files react.development.js and react-dom.development.js

whats id difference between React and ReactDom class.
React function and classes are case sensitive. So writing ReactDOM and ReactDom have difference.  
What is dev dependencies and normal dependencies;
Whats is ~ and carrot symbol
Why we have two json file package-lock.json and package.json
Whats is transitive dependencies;
Command to ignite our app "npx parcel index.html"
"npx parcel" executing the package.
"npm install" install dependencies.
Read parcel on parceljs.Com
dev buld - > npx parcel build index.html[It will throw error because we define App.js as main entry point for our app]

browserslist.dev


npx parcel index.html to run local build but npx parcel build index.html for dev build

add "start":"parcel index.html" in scripts tag of package.json to deb build
add "build":"parcel build index.html" in scripts tag of package.json to build for production.
build and start are just name you can provide anything

now we don't need to write "npx parcel index.html" command, we can use "npm run start". Means it will read the command from script tag.

You can also write "npm start" but we can write "npm build" because start is reserve keyword and npm will automatically manage it self.
But npm build will not work you need write npm run build

what is dom elements: Its basically html tag such as h1, head, body, li etc.
What is react element: React element is not html element. React Element is an object which is avaialble for dom to render than it
becames to an html element.
-------------------
JSX: Its Java Script Syntax which is used to create react elements. Below react code will create h1 heading but its not readable like 
normal html coding. 
const heading = React.createElement("h1", { id: "heading", "Namaste React " }, "Hello World from React");

If we go with nested structure it will become too complex to maintain. So facebook developer created JSX 
which is used to create ReactElements. 

JSX is not html in java script. Its completely different, but JSX have html like syntax. for example
const jsxheading=<h1>Namaste React using JSX</h1>. this jsx code will convert to React element and then react will convert it html element 
and then dom using this to render. 
------------------------

what is ECAM6 it basically standard for java script.

JSX(transpiled before it reaches the JS)- Parcel - Babel(Its java script compiler. Its not created by facebook)

JSX=>React.createElement=>ReactElement - JS Object=>HTMLElement

Babel is converting JSX code to React.createElement
https://babeljs.io/

JSX have cancel casing. for exanple in html we have tabindex but in jsx we have tabindex

const jsxHeading=(put your code in these breckets to write in multiple lines.)

React Component 1. Class Based Component, 2. Functional Component

Function Component is used now, No need to write Class Based Component

Functiona Component is java script Function which return some JSX code/ react element as below example.

const HeadingComponent=()=> {

    return <h1> Namste React</h>;
}
 
 above code can also be written like this. 
 const HeadingComponent=()=>(<h1>Namste React</h1>)

To print this functional component. 

root.render(<HeadingComponent/>)
